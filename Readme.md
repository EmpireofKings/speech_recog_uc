# Speech_Recognition_UC

## Purpose 
The Speech Recognition Package (speech_recog_uc) is a ROS (Robot Operative System) package designed by Universidade de Coimbra, that allow robots to perform high-reliability real-time speech recognition based on a real-time **Voice Activity Detection** algorithm, with high efficiency and low computational resources consumption.
